Maintainer duty
===============

The Debian project specifies the role of a 'maintainer' which is the person
making the Debian package of the program. This role requires an 'sponsor' to
upload the package. As a maintainer you should follow the guide
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide . Your sponsor will be there
helping you succeed.

The most relevant information to update is the changelog file:
Each new release should create a new first paragraph with new release version,
changes, and the maintainer information.

After this is done, follow README.debian to generate the actual source
packages and talk with your sponsor to upload them into the official Debian
package archive.
