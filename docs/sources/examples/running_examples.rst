Running The Examples
--------------------

All the examples assume your machine is running the docker daemon. To run the docker daemon in the background, simply type:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker -d &

Now you can run docker in client mode: all commands will be forwarded to the docker daemon, so the client
can run from any account.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # now you can run docker commands from any account.
      docker help
