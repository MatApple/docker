Most frequently asked questions.
--------------------------------

1. **How much does Docker cost?**

   Docker is 100% free, it is open source, so you can use it without paying.

2. **What open source license are you using?**

   We are using the Apache License Version 2.0, see it here: https://github.com/MatApple/docker/blob/master/LICENSE

3. **Does Docker run on Mac OS X or Windows?**

   Not at this time, Docker currently only runs on Linux, but you can use VirtualBox to run Docker in a virtual machine on your box, and get the best of both worlds. Check out the MacOSX_ and Windows_ intallation guides.

4. **How do containers compare to virtual machines?**

   They are complementary. VMs are best used to allocate chunks of hardware resources. Containers operate at the process level, which makes them very lightweight and perfect as a unit of software delivery.

5. **Can I help by adding some questions and answers?**

   Definitely! You can fork `the repo`_ and edit the documentation sources.
